  update_frequency: 5.0 #The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated.
  publish_frequency: 2.0  #The frequency in Hz for the map to be publish display information.
  static_map: false
  rolling_window: true # Whether or not to use a rolling window version of the costmap. If the static_map parameter is set to true, this parameter must be set to false.
  resolution: 0.05  #The resolution of the map in meters/cell. (double, default: 0.05)
  width: 10 #The width of the map in meters.  (int, default: 10)
  height: 10  #The height of the map in meters.  (int, default: 10)
  lethal_cost_threshold: 70 # The threshold value at which to consider a cost lethal when reading in a map from the map server.
  plugins:
   - {name: static_layer, type: "costmap_2d::StaticLayer"} # The static map layer represents a largely unchanging portion of the costmap, like those generated by SLAM.
   - {name: obstacles_layer, type: "costmap_2d::ObstacleLayer"} # The obstacle layer tracks the obstacles as read by the sensor data.
   - {name: inflation_layer, type: "costmap_2d::InflationLayer"} #The inflation layer is an optimization that adds new values around lethal obstacles (i.e. inflates the obstacles) in order to make the costmap represent the configuration space of the robot.
